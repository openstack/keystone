Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service
========================================

Keystone is an OpenStack service that provides API client authentication,
service discovery, and distributed multi-tenant authorization by implementing
`OpenStack's Identity API`_.

This documentation is primarily targeted towards contributors of the project,
and assumes that you are already familiar with Keystone from an `end-user
perspective`_; however, end users, deployers, and operators will also find it
useful.

.. _`end-user perspective`: https://docs.openstack.org

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the `source
tree`_. Also see the :doc:`getting-started/community` page for other ways to interact with the
community.
