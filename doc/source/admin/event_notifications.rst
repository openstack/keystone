============================
Keystone Event Notifications
============================

Keystone provides notifications about usage data so that 3rd party applications
can use the data for billing, monitoring, or quota purposes. This document
describes the current inclusions and exclusions for Keystone notifications.

Keystone currently supports two notification formats: a Basic Notification,
and a Cloud Auditing Data Federation (`CADF`_) Notification.
The supported operations between the two types of notification formats are
documented below.

Common Notification Structure
=============================

Notifications generated by Keystone are generated in JSON format. An external
application can format them into ATOM format and publish them as a feed.
Currently, all notifications are immediate, meaning they are generated when a
specific event happens. Notifications all adhere to a specific top level
format:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "event_type": "identity.<resource_type>.<operation>",
        "message_id": "<message_id>",
        "payload": {},
        "priority": "INFO",
        "publisher_id": "identity.<hostname>",
        "timestamp": "<timestamp>"
    }

Where ``<resource_type>`` is a Keystone resource, such as user or project, and
``<operation>`` is a Keystone operation, such as created, deleted.

The key differences between the two notification formats (Basic and CADF), lie
within the ``payload`` portion of the notification.

The ``priority`` of the notification being sent is not configurable through
the Keystone configuration file. This value is defaulted to INFO for all
notifications sent in Keystone's case.

Auditing with CADF
==================

Keystone uses the `PyCADF`_ library to emit CADF notifications, these events
adhere to the DMTF `CADF`_ specification. This standard provides auditing
capabilities for compliance with security, operational, and business processes
and supports normalized and categorized event data for federation and
aggregation.

.. _PyCADF: https://docs.openstack.org/pycadf/latest
.. _CADF: http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf

CADF notifications include additional context data around the ``resource``,
the ``action`` and the ``initiator``.

CADF notifications may be emitted by changing the ``notification_format`` to
``cadf`` in the configuration file.

The ``payload`` portion of a CADF Notification is a CADF ``event``, which
is represented as a JSON dictionary. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "typeURI": "http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event",
        "initiator": {
            "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
            "host": {
                "agent": "curl/7.22.0(x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)",
                "address": "127.0.0.1"
            },
            "id": "<initiator_id>"
        },
        "target": {
            "typeURI": "<target_uri>",
            "id": "openstack:1c2fc591-facb-4479-a327-520dade1ea15"
        },
        "observer": {
            "typeURI": "service/security",
            "id": "openstack:3d4a50a9-2b59-438b-bf19-c231f9c7625a"
        },
        "eventType": "activity",
        "eventTime": "2014-02-14T01:20:47.932842+00:00",
        "action": "<action>",
        "outcome": "success",
        "id": "openstack:f5352d7b-bee6-4c22-8213-450e7b646e9f",
    }

Where the following are defined:

* ``<initiator_id>``: ID of the user that performed the operation
* ``<target_uri>``: CADF specific target URI, (i.e.:  data/security/project)
* ``<action>``: The action being performed, typically:
  ``<operation>``. ``<resource_type>``

.. note::
   The ``eventType`` property of the CADF payload is different from the
   ``event_type`` property of a notifications. The former (``eventType``) is a
   CADF keyword which designates the type of event that is being measured, this
   can be: `activity`, `monitor` or `control`. Whereas the latter
   (``event_type``) is described in previous sections as:
   `identity.<resource_type>.<operation>`

Additionally there may be extra keys present depending on the operation being
performed, these will be discussed below.

Reason
------

There is a specific ``reason`` object that will be present for the following
PCI-DSS related events:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 45 10 45
   :header-rows: 1

   * - PCI-DSS Section
     - reasonCode
     - reasonType
   * - 8.1.6 Limit repeated access attempts by locking out the user after more than X failed attempts.
     - 401
     - Maximum number of <number> login attempts exceeded.
   * - 8.2.3 Passwords must meet the established criteria.
     - 400
     - Password does not meet expected requirements: <regex_description>
   * - 8.2.4 Password must be changed every X days.
     - 401
     - Password for <user> expired and must be changed
   * - 8.2.5 Do not let users reuse the last X passwords.
     - 400
     - Changed password cannot be identical to the last <number> passwords.
   * - Other - Prevent passwords from being changed for a minimum of X days.
     - 401
     - Cannot change password before minimum age <number> days is met

The reason object will contain the following keys:

* ``reasonType``: Description of the PCI-DSS event
* ``reasonCode``: HTTP response code for the event

For more information, see
:doc:`../admin/identity-security-compliance`
for configuring PCI-DSS in keystone.

Supported Events

The following table displays the compatibility between resource types and
operations.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 6 8 8
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Resource Type
     - Supported Operations
     - typeURI

Example Notification - Project Create
-------------------------------------

The following is an example of a notification that is sent when a project is
created. This example can be applied for any ``create``, ``update`` or
``delete`` event that is seen in the table above. The ``<action>`` and
``typeURI`` fields will be change.

The difference to note is the inclusion of the ``resource_info`` field which
contains the ``<resource_id>`` that is undergoing the operation. Thus creating
a common element between the CADF and Basic notification formats.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "event_type": "identity.project.created",
        "message_id": "0156ee79-b35f-4cef-ac37-d4a85f231c69",
        "payload": {
            "typeURI": "http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event",
            "initiator": {
                "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
                "host": {
                    "agent": "curl/7.22.0(x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)",
                    "address": "127.0.0.1"
                },
                "id": "c9f76d3c31e142af9291de2935bde98a"
            },

                "id": "openstack:1c2fc591-facb-4479-a327-520dade1ea15"
            },
            "observer": {
                "typeURI": "service/security",
                "id": "openstack:3d4a50a9-2b59-438b-bf19-c231f9c7625a"
            },
            "eventType": "activity",

            "resource_info": "671da331c47d4e29bb6ea1d270154ec3"
        },
        "priority": "INFO",
        "publisher_id": "identity.host1234",
        "timestamp": "2013-08-29 19:03:45.960280"
    }

Example Notification - Authentication
-------------------------------------

The following is an example of a notification that is sent when a user
authenticates with Keystone.

Note that this notification will be emitted if a user successfully
authenticates, and when a user fails to authenticate.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "event_type": "identity.authenticate",
        "message_id": "1371a590-d5fd-448f-b3bb-a14dead6f4cb",
        "payload": {
            "typeURI": "http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event",
            "initiator": {
                "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
                "host": {
                    "agent": "curl/7.22.0(x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)",
                    "address": "127.0.0.1"
                },
                "id": "c9f76d3c31e142af9291de2935bde98a"
            },
            "target": {
                "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
                "id": "openstack:1c2fc591-facb-4479-a327-520dade1ea15"
            },
            "observer": {
                "typeURI": "service/security",
                "id": "openstack:3d4a50a9-2b59-438b-bf19-c231f9c7625a"
            },
            "eventType": "activity",
            "eventTime": "2014-02-14T01:20:47.932842+00:00",
            "action": "authenticate",
            "outcome": "success",
            "id": "openstack:f5352d7b-bee6-4c22-8213-450e7b646e9f"
        },
        "priority": "INFO",
        "publisher_id": "identity.host1234",
        "timestamp": "2014-02-14T01:20:47.932842"
    }

Example Notification - Federated Authentication
-----------------------------------------------

The following is an example of a notification that is sent when a user
authenticates with Keystone via Federation.

This example is similar to the one seen above, however the ``initiator``
portion of the ``payload`` contains a new ``credential`` section.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "event_type": "identity.authenticate",
        "message_id": "1371a590-d5fd-448f-b3bb-a14dead6f4cb",
        "payload": {
            "typeURI": "http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event",
            "initiator": {
                "credential": {
                    "type": "http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0",
                    "token": "671da331c47d4e29bb6ea1d270154ec3",
                    "identity_provider": "ACME",
                    "user": "c9f76d3c31e142af9291de2935bde98a",
                    "groups": [
                        "developers"
                    ]
                },
                "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
                "host": {
                    "agent": "curl/7.22.0(x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)",
                    "address": "127.0.0.1"
                },
                "id": "c9f76d3c31e142af9291de2935bde98a"
            },
            "target": {
                "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
                "id": "openstack:1c2fc591-facb-4479-a327-520dade1ea15"
            },
            "observer": {
                "typeURI": "service/security",
                "id": "openstack:3d4a50a9-2b59-438b-bf19-c231f9c7625a"
            },
            "eventType": "activity",
            "eventTime": "2014-02-14T01:20:47.932842+00:00",
            "action": "authenticate",
            "outcome": "success",
            "id": "openstack:f5352d7b-bee6-4c22-8213-450e7b646e9f"
        },
        "priority": "INFO",
        "publisher_id": "identity.host1234",
        "timestamp": "2014-02-14T01:20:47.932842"
    }

Example Notification - Role Assignment
--------------------------------------

The following is an example of a notification that is sent when a role is
granted or revoked to a project or domain, for a user or group.

It is important to note that this type of notification has many new keys
that convey the necessary information. Expect the following in the ``payload``:
``role``, ``inherited_to_project``, ``project`` or ``domain``, ``user`` or
``group``. With the exception of ``inherited_to_project``, each will represent
the unique identifier of the resource type.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "event_type": "identity.role_assignment.created",
        "message_id": "a5901371-d5fd-b3bb-448f-a14dead6f4cb",
        "payload": {
            "typeURI": "http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event",
            "initiator": {
                "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
                "host": {
                    "agent": "curl/7.22.0(x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)",
                    "address": "127.0.0.1"
                },
                "id": "c9f76d3c31e142af9291de2935bde98a"
            },
            "target": {
                "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
                "id": "openstack:1c2fc591-facb-4479-a327-520dade1ea15"
            },
            "observer": {
                "typeURI": "service/security",
                "id": "openstack:3d4a50a9-2b59-438b-bf19-c231f9c7625a"
            },
            "eventType": "activity",
            "eventTime": "2014-08-20T01:20:47.932842+00:00",
            "role": "0e6b990380154a2599ce6b6e91548a68",
            "project": "24bdcff1aab8474895dbaac509793de1",
            "inherited_to_projects": false,
            "group": "c1e22dc67cbd469ea0e33bf428fe597a",
            "action": "created.role_assignment",
            "outcome": "success",
            "id": "openstack:f5352d7b-bee6-4c22-8213-450e7b646e9f"
        },
        "priority": "INFO",
        "publisher_id": "identity.host1234",
        "timestamp": "2014-08-20T01:20:47.932842"
    }

Example Notification - Expired Password
---------------------------------------

The following is an example of a notification that is sent when a user
attempts to authenticate but their password has expired.

In this example, the ``payload`` contains a ``reason`` portion which contains
both a ``reasonCode`` and ``reasonType``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "priority": "INFO",
       "_unique_id": "222441bdc958423d8af6f28f9c558614",
       "event_type": "identity.authenticate",
       "timestamp": "2016-11-11 18:31:11.290821",
       "publisher_id": "identity.host1234",
       "payload": {
           "typeURI": "http://schemas.dmtf.org/cloud/audit/1.0/event",
           "initiator": {
               "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
               "host": {
                   "address": "127.0.0.1"
               },
               "id": "73a19db6-e26b-5313-a6df-58d297fa652e"
           },
           "target": {
               "typeURI": "service/security/account/user",
               "id": "c23e6cb7-abe0-5e42-b7f7-4c4104ea77b0"
           },
           "observer": {
               "typeURI": "service/security",
               "id": "9bdddeda6a0b451e9e0439646e532afd"
           },
           "eventType": "activity",
           "eventTime": "2016-11-11T18:31:11.156356+0000",
           "reason": {
               "reasonCode": 401,
               "reasonType": "The password is expired and needs to be reset for user: ed1ab0b40f284fb48fea9e25d0d157fc"
           },
           "action": "authenticate",
           "outcome": "failure",
           "id": "78cd795f-5850-532f-9ab1-5adb04e30c0f"
       },
       "message_id": "9a97e9d0-fef1-4852-8e82-bb693358bc46"
   }

Basic Notifications
===================

All basic notifications contain a limited amount of information, specifically,
just the resource type, operation, and resource id.

The ``payload`` portion of a Basic Notification is a single key-value pair.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "resource_info": <resource_id>
    }

Where ``<resource_id>`` is the unique identifier assigned to the
``resource_type`` that is undergoing the ``<operation>``.

Supported Events
----------------

The following table displays the compatibility between resource types and
operations.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 6 8
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Resource Type
     - Supported Operations

Note, ``trusts`` are an immutable resource, they do not support ``update``
operations.

Example Notification
--------------------

This is an example of a notification sent for a newly created user:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "event_type": "identity.user.created",
        "message_id": "0156ee79-b35f-4cef-ac37-d4a85f231c69",
        "payload": {
            "resource_info": "671da331c47d4e29bb6ea1d270154ec3"
        },
        "priority": "INFO",
        "publisher_id": "identity.host1234",
        "timestamp": "2013-08-29 19:03:45.960280"
    }

If the operation fails, the notification won't be sent, and no special error
notification will be sent. Information about the error is handled through
normal exception paths.

Recommendations for consumers
=============================

One of the most important notifications that Keystone emits is for project
deletions (``event_type`` = ``identity.project.deleted``). This event should
indicate to the rest of OpenStack that all resources (such as virtual machines)
associated with the project should be deleted.

Projects can also have update events (``event_type`` =
``identity.project.updated``), wherein the project has been disabled. Keystone
ensures this has an immediate impact on the accessibility of the project's
resources by revoking tokens with authorization on the project, but should
**not** have a direct impact on the projects resources (in other words, virtual
machines should **not** be deleted).

Opting out of certain notifications
===================================

There are many notifications that Keystone emits and some deployers may only
care about certain events. In Keystone there is a way to opt-out of certain
notifications. In ``/etc/keystone/keystone.conf`` you can set ``opt_out`` to
the event you wish to opt-out of. It is possible to opt-out of multiple events.

Example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [DEFAULT]
    notification_opt_out = identity.user.created
    notification_opt_out = identity.role_assignment.created
    notification_opt_out = identity.authenticate.pending

This will opt-out notifications for user creation, role assignment creation and
successful authentications. For a list of event types that can be used, refer
to: `Telemetry Measurements`_.

By default, messages for the following authentication events are suppressed
since they are too noisy: ``identity.authenticate.success``,
``identity.authenticate.pending`` and ``identity.authenticate.failed``.
