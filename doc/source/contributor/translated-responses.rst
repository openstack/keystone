Translated responses
====================

The Keystone server can provide error responses translated into the language in
the ``Accept-Language`` header of the request. In order to test this in your
development environment, there's a couple of things you need to do.

1. Build the message files. Run the following command in your keystone
   directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python setup.py compile_catalog

This will generate .mo files like keystone/locale/[lang]/LC_MESSAGES/[lang].mo

2. When running Keystone, set the ``KEYSTONE_LOCALEDIR`` environment variable
   to the keystone/locale directory. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ KEYSTONE_LOCALEDIR=/opt/stack/keystone/keystone/locale uwsgi --http 127.0.0.1:35357 --wsgi-file $(which keystone-wsgi-admin)


Now you can get a translated error response:

.. code-block:: bash

 $ curl -s -H "Accept-Language: zh" http://localhost:5000/notapath | python -mjson.tool
 {
     "error": {
         "code": 404,
         "message": "\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u8cc7\u6e90\u3002",
         "title": "Not Found"
     }
 }
