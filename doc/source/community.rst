Getting Involved
================

The OpenStack community is a very friendly group and there are places online to
join in with the community. Feel free to ask questions. This document points
you to some of the places where you can communicate with people.

How to Join the Community
=========================

Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing,
and there are no formal membership requirements. The best way to join the
community is to talk with others online or at a meetup and offer contributions
through Launchpad_, the wiki_, or blogs. We welcome all types of contributions,

from blueprint designs to documentation to testing to deployment scripts.

#openstack-keystone on Freenode IRC Network
-------------------------------------------

You can find Keystone folks in `<irc://freenode.net/#openstack-keystone>`_.
This is usually the best place to ask questions and find your way around. IRC
stands for Internet Relay Chat and it is a way to chat online in real time.
You can also ask a question and come back to the log files to read the answer
later. Logs for the #openstack IRC channels are stored at
`<http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/>`_.

For more information regarding OpenStack IRC channels please visit the
`OpenStack IRC Wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/IRC>`_.

OpenStack Wiki
--------------

The wiki is a living source of knowledge. It is edited by the community, and
has collections of links and other sources of information. Typically the pages
are a good place to write drafts for specs or documentation, describe a
blueprint, or collaborate with others.

Keystone on Launchpad
---------------------

Launchpad is a code hosting that OpenStack is using to track bugs, feature
work, and releases of OpenStack. Like other OpenStack projects, Keystone source
code is hosted on git.openstack.org

* `Keystone Project Page on Launchpad <http://launchpad.net/keystone>`_
* `Keystone Source Repository <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/keystone>`_

Within launchpad, we use
`blueprints <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone>`_, to track feature
work, and track `bugs <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone>`_ as well. If
you are looking for a place to get started contributing to keystone, please
look at any bugs for Keystone that are tagged as `low-hanging-fruit
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bugs?field.tag=low-hanging-fruit>`_.

from around the internet, as well as providing inside information on upcoming
events and posts from OpenStack contributors.
