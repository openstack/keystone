# Using this feature is *NOT* recommended. Instead, use the `keystone-manage
# bootstrap` command. The value of this option is treated as a "shared secret"
# that can be used to bootstrap Keystone through the API. This "token" does not
# represent a user (it has no identity), and carries no explicit authorization
# (it effectively bypasses most authorization checks). If set to `None`, the
# value is ignored and the `admin_token` middleware is effectively disabled.
# However, to completely disable `admin_token` in production (highly
