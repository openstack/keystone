audit_ids:
  description: |
    A list of one or two audit IDs. An audit ID is a
    unique, randomly generated, URL-safe string that you can use to
    track a token.  The first audit ID is the current audit ID for the
    token.  The second audit ID is present for only re-scoped tokens
    and is the audit ID from the token before it was re-scoped. A re-
    scoped token is one that was exchanged for another token of the
    same or different scope.  You can use these audit IDs to track the
    use of a token or chain of tokens across multiple requests and
    endpoints without exposing the token ID to non-privileged users.

    contains ``password``. Later, if the token is exchanged by using
    the token authentication method one or more times, the
    subsequently created tokens contain both ``password`` and
    ``token`` in their ``methods`` attribute.  Unlike multi-factor
    authentication, the ``methods`` attribute merely indicates the
    methods that were used to authenticate the user in exchange for a

    A user's default project must not be a domain. Setting this

    If the user does not have authorization to their default project,
    the default project is ignored at token creation.  (Since v3.1)

explicit_unscoped_string:
  description: |
    The authorization scope (Since v3.4). Specify
    ``unscoped`` to make an explicit unscoped token request, which
    returns an unscoped response without any authorization. This
    request behaves the same as a token request with no scope where
    the user has no default project defined. If an explicit,
    ``unscoped`` token request is not made and the user has
    authorization to their default project, then the response will
    return a project-scoped token. If a default project is not defined,
    a token is issued without an explicit scope of authorization,
    which is the same as asking for an explicit unscoped token.

    that are not part of the resource's default attributes.
    Generally these are custom fields that are added to a resource in keystone
    by operators for their own specific uses,
    such as ``email`` and ``description`` for users.

    not specified and ``is_domain`` is ``false``, then the project will use its
    owning domain as its parent. If ``is_domain`` is ``true`` (i.e. the project
    is acting as a domain), then ``parent_id`` must not specified (or if it is,
    it must be ``null``) since domains have no parents.

    ``parent_id`` is immutable, and can't be updated after the project is
    created - hence a project cannot be moved within the hierarchy.
