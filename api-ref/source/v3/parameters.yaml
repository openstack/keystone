scope:
  description: |
    The authorization scope.  (Since v3.4) Specify
    ``unscoped`` to make an explicit unscoped token request, which
    returns an unscoped response without any authorization. This
    request behaves the same as a token request with no scope where
    the user has no default project defined.  If you do not make an
    explicit ``unscoped`` token request and your role has a default
    project, the response might return a project- scoped token. If a
    default project is not defined, a token is issued without an
    explicit scope of authorization, which is the same as asking for
    an explicit unscoped token.
  in: body
  required: false
  type: string
scope_1:
  description: |
    The authorization scope.  - Specify ``project``
    to scope to a project, by ID or name. If you   specify the project
    by name, you must also specify the project   domain to uniquely
    identify the project. Because a project can   have the same name
    as its owning domain, the scope is determined,   as follows:    -
    If the project name is truly unique, the token is scoped to the
    project.    - If a name clash exists between a project acting as a
    domain and a     regular project within that domain, the token is
    scoped to the     regular project.    - In a name-clash situation,
    if the user wants the token scoped to     the project acting as
    the domain, you must either specify use     the project ID to
    specify the scope or rename either the     project acting as a
    domain or the regular project.    Alternatively, you can use a
    domain name to uniquely identify the   project.  - Specify
    ``domain`` to scope to a domain, by ID or name with   equivalent
    results to project scoping. The catalog returned from   a domain-
    scoped request contains all endpoints of a project-   scoped
    catalog, excluding ones that require a project ID as part   of
    their URL.  You cannot simultaneously scope a token to a project
    and domain.
