    A potential security related issue is fixed where a token of the user from a
    read-only backend (i.e. LDAP) continues being accepted after the user is
    disabled in the backend. This is caused by the fact that Keystone does not
    receive any notification for that and is not able to revoke such tokens.
    See https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2122615 for details.
