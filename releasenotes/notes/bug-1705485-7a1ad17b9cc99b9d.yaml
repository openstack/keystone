    The `change_password` protection policy can be removed from file-based
    policies. This policy is no longer used to protect the self-service
    password change API since the logic was moved into code. Note that the
    administrative password reset functionality is still protected via policy
    on the `update_user` API.

    [`bug 1705485 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1705485>`_]
    A `previous change <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/404022/>`_ removed
    policy from the self-service password API. Since a user is required to
    authenticate to change their password, protection via policy didn't
    necessarily make sense. This change removes the default policy from code,
    since it is no longer required or used by the service. Note that
    administrative password resets for users are still protected via policy
    through a separate endpoint.
