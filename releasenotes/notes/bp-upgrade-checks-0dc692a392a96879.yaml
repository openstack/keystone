    [`Community Goal <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/stein/upgrade-checkers.html>`_]
    Support has been added for developers to write pre-upgrade checks.
    Operators can run these checks using ``keystone-status upgrade check``.
    This allows operators to be more confident when upgrading their deployments
    by having a tool that automates programmable checks against the deployment
    configuration or dataset.
