deprecations:
  - >
    The ``/OS-FEDERATION/projects`` and ``/OS-FEDERATION/domains`` APIs are
    deprecated in favor of the ``/v3/auth/projects`` and ``/v3/auth/domains``
    APIs. These APIs were originally marked as deprecated during the Juno
    release cycle, but we never deprecated using ``versionutils`` from oslo.
    More information regarding this deprecation can be found in the `patch
    <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/115423/>`_ that proposed the deprecation.

    [`bug 1728690 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1728690>`_]
    The ``member_role_id`` and ``member_role_name`` config options were used to
    create a default member role for keystone v2 role assignments, but with the
    removal of the v2 API it is no longer necessary to create this default
    role. This option is deprecated and will be removed in the S release. If
    you are depending on having a predictable role name and ID for this member
    role you will need to update your tooling.
  - >
    The ``enabled`` config option of the ``trust`` feature is deprecated and
    will be removed in the next release. Trusts will then always be enabled.
